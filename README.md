Module for selecting polygonal ROIs on images, spline fitting and ROI expansion

## Instructions

As a first step, I would recommend checking out the [tutorial notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/tsmblad/matplotlib-polyroi/blob/master/scripts/Demonstration.ipynb). This can be run in the cloud using Binder (please note that it may take several minutes to open the notebook):

To run locally, download the code and install the relevant requirements (requirements.txt) in a virtual environment.

## Installation

To explore further and incorporate into your own analysis pipelines, you can install the package from PyPI using pip:

    pip install matplotlib-polyroi

If you want to make changes to the code you can download/clone this folder, navigate to it, and run:

    pip install -e .[dev]
